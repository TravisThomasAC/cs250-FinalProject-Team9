  So far, we have finished implementing the basic strchture of the program. We have main class which is a do while loop, if user don't want to quit, the program will continue load coversition class. conversition class is a class that will require commands from user. Based on different commands, the class will rediract usere to different classes. For example: 

```
Menu: 1.Like | 2.Explore | 3.Daily Selection | 4.quit
```

If user type "1", then the program will direct user to liked song list, then like class will show user the music list. The like class will also ask the user to sort the list if the user wants.  In the rest of important classes, such as ***explore()*** and ***dailySelection()***, we will impliment our rendom suggesting system and forcast suggesting system. 

In explore class, the program will read the Cloud musiclist CSV file and rendomly selet few songs and feed it to user based on song's name initial letter sequence. If the user likes any of the songs, we will ask if the user want to add it to his liked music list. If he do, the program will mark a song with y in the last column. and add it to like list. ***need more stuff here***

In the daily selection class, the progrm will select songs that the user may like based on the forcasting of whether the user will like it (The algorithm will be explained later). ***need more stuff here***

## Algorithm Picking

  For the algorithm for forcasting potential user like song, which is [Collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering), there are two algorithms that we know. 
  
#### Memory-based

  The first one is user grouping method. In this method, the althoritm will first track down people who have simlier activities, then recommond songs to each other by their playlists. For example, scores are assigned to different actions:

```
Repeat song = 5, Share = 4, Like = 3, Play = 2, 
Played completely = 1, Skip = -1, Dislike = -5
```

Then a perrsons perference would be a N-Dimenional vector. Here N is the number of songs by default. By using the cosine of the vector angle, which is generated by two vector, we can know how similar two users can be. Cosine of 0 degree, which means two people are exactly the same, is 1. Cosine of 180 degree, which means two people have the opposite perference, is -1. The equation is:

Assume we have vector $\vec a$ and $\vec b$,

$$cos(A) = \frac{\vec a \cdot \vec b}{|\vec a| \times |\vec b|}$$

This prediction method is very accurate, but there are too many calculations, and it is not accurate for new user. 

#### Model-based

  As for the second method, the algorthm will analys the playlist of a person, then do recommendations. Models such as latent factor is used in this method. 

  Of course, in the real world, if we implement algorithm based on song, the second demention factor will repidly increase. Plus there will be too many songs. Therefore it will be more effecient if we calculate based on tags of the song. For example, for "The Sound of Slience" by Simon & Garfunel, tags can be Folk Rock, 60s, and Movie Track. Due to the time we have is limited, we would not build tags databeses, therefore we would analys by songs. Additionally, we would use the second method to calcutated scores because we do not have time to build multiple users.
